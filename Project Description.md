This project is a gaming platform called “NERVE” made in C language. 
It consists of three different games:

•	MBTI personality test
•	Truth or dare
•	A maze game

The first game, not exactly a game but a personality test which consists of various questions which will determine your personality depending on your answers. The main thing used in this test is the use of nested if.
The second game, which is truth or dare, is a game to be played among multiplayers, which will first ask for number of players and will randomly choose a player and give choice to that player to choose either truth or dare. Then a random question will be generated and will automatically move on to the next turn. It’ll give option to exit the game after every question asked. The main focus of this game is the use of rand() function.
Our third and last game maze, is an interesting and a complicated game in which you have to take the ball from one point to another without touching the walls. The whole maze is made according to the X and Y-axis using SetPoint/SetCursor. It is made up of using various functions and structs. The user directs the rat where to move as input from the four keys which are assigned with different directions (for further details, see maze game’s instructions nn the output screen)

>>Main Feature:

The main feature of our program is that we have converted our games into three different header files to avoid confusion and mess. Thus, making it easier for the user to read and understand the code.
